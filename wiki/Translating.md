## FAQ

### How can I tell where each string is used?

Visit https://starbestfit.com and try to find the specific string while language is set to English.

You can also check the resource you're translating for info on where you can find that string. See the table below for a reference:

| Resource | Where it's used |
| --- | --- |
| common.json | Common strings used on all pages in places like the header/footer, and settings. |
| home.json | Strings used on the homepage, including the event creation form and the about info. |
| privacy.json | Strings used on the [privacy policy page](https://starbestfit.com/privacy). |
| help.json | Strings used on the [help page](https://starbestfit.com/how-to). |

### What should I do if my language is fully translated?

First of all, great! It's thanks to people like you that everyone can use Star Fit, no matter what language they speak or where in the world they live.

If you'd like, you can look through the existing translations to check for spelling/grammar mistakes and fix them up.

The source strings can also change as Star Fit is updated, so check occasionally for new things to translate.

### Should I use formal or informal language?

If your language has formal/informal variants, it's up to you which to use when translating based on what you think is appropriate for Star Fit. You should first check any existing translations for your language to make sure you don't mix them though.
